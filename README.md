# Description
A slice of life mod for Pixelmon Reforged! Adds a bunch of tweaks to pixelmon!

This mod works can be added to clients or servers, but does not require the opposite one to be compatible! E.g. You can add this to your server, and clients won't need it to join.

# Features
As of version 1.0, there is the following:
- Shiny pokemon sparkle and have a sound effect when they spawn. Inspired by Legends Arceus
- Healers now drop themselves when broken, instead of an aluminium plate
- Pokemon no longer spawn when `doMobSpawning` gamerule is false
- Boss pokemon are colored in the battle UI
- Boss pokemon colors are tweaked
