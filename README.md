# Description
A slice of life mod for Pixelmon Reforged! Adds a bunch of tweaks to pixelmon!

This mod works can be added to clients or servers, but does not require the opposite one to be compatible! E.g. You can add this to your server, and clients won't need it to join.

# Features
As of version 1.2, there is the following:
- Shiny pokemon sparkle and have a sound effect when they spawn. Inspired by Legends Arceus! (see clip below for footage)
- Healers now drop themselves when broken, instead of an aluminium ingot
- Added the ability for resource packs to make battle music for specific pokemon! By default, the battle music from Legends Arceus to Arceus has been implemented!
- Added 2 new gamerules: `doPokemonSpawning` and `doTrainerSpawning`. Allows you to disable spawns in specific worlds easily
- Boss pokemon are colored in the battle UI
- Boss pokemon colors are tweaked
- The level of hypertraining is configurable. It defaults to 50, from Pixelmon's 100
- Tridents are now obtainable in water related loop chests and from strong water pokemon drops
